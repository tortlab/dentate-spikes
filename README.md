# Waveform-based Classification of Dentate Spikes (WFbC)
This repository contains the scripts for detecting and classifying dentate spikes according to the following publication:

Santiago, R. M., Lopes-dos-Santos, V., Jones, E. A. A., Huang, Y., Dupret, D., & Tort, A. B. (2023). Waveform-based classification of dentate spikes. bioRxiv, 2023-10. [https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.24.563826](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.24.563826)


The Python code is available at "dentatespike.py".

To use it, place it in the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook or simply map it using:
```sh
import sys
sys.path.append('/path') # replace 'path' with the directory where the file is located.
import dentatespike as ds
```

See Jupyter Notebooks for usage examples.
